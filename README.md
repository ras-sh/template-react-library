# @ras-sh/template-react-library

ðŸ“¦ React library template with TypeScript, testing setup, and modern build tooling.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - Full type safety with modern TS features and React support
- **[tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/)** - Fast, zero-config bundler powered by esbuild
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)** - Fast unit testing with React Testing Library
- **[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)** - Automated version management and changelog generation
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated CI/CD workflows for testing and publishing
- **Pre-publish safety** - Automatic checks before publishing to prevent broken releases

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test
```

## Building Your Library

1. Add React components in `src/`

## CI/CD

This template includes automated GitHub Actions workflows:

- **CI Workflow** - Runs on every PR and push to main
  - Linting with Biome
  - Type checking with TypeScript
  - Unit tests with Vitest
  - Build verification

- **Release Workflow** - Automated publishing with Changesets
  - Creates version bump PRs automatically
  - Publishes to npm when merged

### Setup for Automated Publishing

To enable automated npm publishing, add an `NPM_TOKEN` secret to your GitHub repository:

1. Create an npm access token at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/~/tokens)
2. Go to your GitHub repository settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
3. Add a new secret named `NPM_TOKEN` with your npm token

## Publishing

This template uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management.

### Manual Release

1. **Create a changeset** when you make changes:
   ```bash
   pnpm changeset
   ```
   Follow the prompts to describe your changes (patch, minor, or major).

2. **Commit and push your changes** including the changeset file

3. **Automated workflow will**:
   - Create a "Version Packages" PR with version bumps and changelog
   - When you merge that PR, automatically publish to npm

### Local Publishing (Alternative)

You can also publish manually:

```bash
pnpm version    # Update versions from changesets
pnpm release    # Build and publish to npm
```

> **Note**: The `prepublishOnly` script ensures all checks pass before publishing.
